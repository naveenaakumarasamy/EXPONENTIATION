# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: naveenaa 
#RegisterNumber: 22003091
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a**b
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",c)

```

## Output:

![exponentiation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113497406/192078458-a6803d7b-baee-4a8c-863d-49458809723b.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
